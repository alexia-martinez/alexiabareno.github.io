            <p>
                Barcode Scanner is a mobile application that creates an exportable spreadsheet containing scanned
                warehouse inventory items. It was designed to improve the larger inventory process by replacing the
                traditional count on paper and by simplifying the identification of missing inventory. I followed
                a user centered design process by asking for user's feedback often. The steps in my process were:
                user research, flow diagrams, sketching/wireframing (and iterating based on feedback), development,
                and testing.

                <b>Problem: the process for counting inventory varied among most branches and this made it difficult for
                    operations management to address discrepancies in reported numbers.
                </b>
            </p>

            <p>
                My supervisor explained that I was to design a barcode scanning app as part of improving the overall
                inventory process. To begin this project, I recruited seven managers to be in my pilot group: two were
                in California and the rest were in Illinois, Georgia, Texas, Louisiana, and Virginia. I selected these
                branches because they all varied in size and provided diversity to my group. I was given a day to
                interview the group and gather information about their inventory practices.
            </p>


            <p>
                I asked questions on the themes of organization, process, and tools. Some of these questions were:
            </p>

            <p>
                <i><b>
                "Describe your method of organization in the warehouse."<br>
                "Could you please describe the steps that you take to do inventory?"<br>
                "Could you please tell me what you use to perform inventory counts?"<br>
                "Tell me about a time that you were frustrated while doing inventory counts."
                </b></i>
            </p>

            <p>
                Here is some of what I learned:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>Larger branches had come up with 'shortcuts' to speed up inventory counts</li>
                <li>One of the managers had created a macro-enabled spreadsheet that identifies missing inventory</li>
                <li>All branches had inventory organized based on item type</li>
                <li>Smaller branches took about 20-30 mins to do inventory; larger branches took 45min-1hr+</li>
                <li>Branches once used an inventory tracking software but abandoned it because it became outdated</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                After the call, I spent another day organizing my data to present to my supervisor.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>
                    Idea: the inventory app will accommodate all branches regardless of size by cutting down
                    the time it takes branches to count their stock.
                </b>
            </p>

            <p>
                My supervisor decided that we had enough information to continue this project and develop the app.
                As an addition, she decided to include the manager's macro-enabled Excel file (audit) as another tool
                to be used in the revamped process. The audit cross-checked two files: an Excel download
                from the company's system which included all inventory owned by a branch and an Excel file produced by
                the app containing the scanned items present in the warehouse. Highlighted items in the audit indicated
                potentially missing inventory.
            </p>

            <p>
                The revamped count process is shown below:
            </p>

            </div>

            <p>
                My next step was to deliver some flow diagrams.
            </p>
        </div>

<!--FLOW DIAGRAMS-->

            <h1>diagrams</h1>
            <p>I created a user flow to show the paths that users would take to complete the main task of scanning
                inventory and exporting the spreadsheet.
            </p>
            <p>
                Below is my brainstorm session for the app's structure:
            </p>
            <!--MAKE THE IMAGE BELOW A PNG FILE-->
            <div class="imagegallery">
                <img src="Images/TVM/flowbrainstorm.PNG"/>
            </div>
            <p>
                Below is an app flow diagram:
            </p>
            <div class="imagegallery">
                <img src="Images/TVM/flowdiagram.png"/>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<!--DESIGN-->
<div id="design">
    <div class="text2">
        <div class="wrapper">
            <h1>design</h1>
            <p>
                The following rough sketches helped me begin visualizing the interface:
            </p>

            <div class="imagegallery">
                <img src="Images/TVM/handsketch1.png"/>
                <img src="Images/TVM/handsketch2.png"/>
            </div>

            <p>
                I am not a visual designer, so I used elements of Material Design and followed it as a guideline. All
                branch managers and warehouse workers were given an Android company phone so I felt it was appropriate
                to design the app using Material Design.
            </p>

            <p>
                Below are some key screens from the app.
            </p>

            <!--HOME-->
            <div class="exception2 wrapper keyscreen">
                <img class="border" src= "Images/TVM/images/image6.png">
            </div>
            <div class="exception2 wrapper">
                <h3>home screen</h3>
                <p>
                    Upon opening the app, the managers see all created spreadsheets and have the options of opening
                    a spreadsheet, deleting a spreadsheet, creating a new spreadsheet, and sending (exporting) a
                    spreadsheet.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!--NEW SPREADSHEET-->
            <div class="exception2 wrapper keyscreen">
                <img class="border" src= "Images/TVM/images/image4.png">
            </div>
            <div class="exception2 wrapper">
                <h3>new spreadsheet</h3>
                <p>
                    One of the requested features was to make it possible for managers to enter item numbers (which
                    specify item type) and zone tags (which specify the warehouse location of an item.) Other
                    barcode scanning apps required managers to input this information every time they scanned a barcode,
                    but I added two fields for managers to specify this information once. With every scan,
                    the app will continuously add the item number and zone tag until the manager clears the fields or
                    changes them.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!--SENDING SPREADSHEET-->
            <div class="exception2 wrapper keyscreen">
                <img class="border" src= "Images/TVM/images/image2.png">

            <div class="exception2 wrapper">
                <h3>sending a spreadsheet</h3>
                <p>
                    Managers are given options on how they would like to export their spreadsheet. Most preferred
                    the email method but we gave them a variety of options.
                </p>

<!--DEVELOPMENT-->

            <h1>development</h1>
            <p>
                I worked with another IT Intern who was comfortable with app development.
                Since he was working in LA and I in Huntington Beach, we would meet once a week so that I could check
                in with him. Together, we'd go over his work to make sure that it was reflective of the requirements
                I had given him.
            </p>

            <p>
                It took about three weeks for him to finish the first prototype of the app. After getting approval
                from our supervisors, I proceeded to test it with my pilot group.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<!--TESTING-->
<div id="testing">
    <div class="text2">
        <div class="wrapper">
            <h1>testing</h1>
            <p>
                I ordered several bluetooth barcode scanners to be paired up with the Samsung
                phones and to be used with the app.
            </p>

            <p>
                The tasks for testing were very simple:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>Download the inventory list from the company system</li>
                <li>Scan 20 items from the warehouse</li>
                <li>Export the spreadsheet from the app</li>
                <li>Upload the files from steps 1 and 2 to the audit file and run the macro</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                Since I wasn't able to oversee testing, I had to conduct these tests remotely by handing
                over the instructions and tools and waiting a week to hear back from the managers. It wasn't the best way
                to do testing, but it was the only way.
            </p>

            <p> I conducted another group call to learn about their thoughts
                and suggestions for improvement. One of the
                requested changes was that the 'Back' button be moved towards the bottom of the screen because it felt
                odd to have it towards the top. I agreed that it was awkwardly placed and later realized that by having
                it towards the bottom, the manager could use their thumb (while holding their phone in one hand) to
                go back.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<!--REFLECTION-->
<div id="reflection">
    <div class="text2">
        <div class="wrapper">
            <h1>reflection</h1>
            <p>
                I was happy to learn that the app was received positively among the group. Unfortunately, because of the
                priority of other projects, I was unable to pursue the launch of this new process among other branches.
                It did feel amazing, however, to know that the branches I had worked with during the study decided to
                continue using the new process.
            </p>

            <p>
                I would have changed two things about this project. First, I would have liked to have worked with the
                other IT intern from the start because I think he would have felt more comfortable working with me
                and he might have felt more ownership of the project rather than it just being a handoff.
            </p>

            <p>
                Second, I would have liked to conduct the testing in person to observe the managers as they used the
                app and determine if it fit well within the inventory process. I feel like opportunities for insight
                were lost in having done testing the way we did, but I understand that sometimes situations are not
                ideal and that's ok. It's about making the best out of what has been given.
            </p>

            <p>
                I'm very grateful for this experience because it made me confirm my desire to enter the UX field. It's
                very fulfilling to know that my efforts made someone's job easier and more enjoyable.
