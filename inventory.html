            <p>
                I conducted a pilot study that looked into establishing a uniform monthly inventory
                count process for company branches nationwide. I studied my supervisor's proposed
                solution of designing an app that would help managers scan inventory items into an exportable
                spreadsheet. I divided my study into the following phases: user research, information architecture,
                design, development, and testing. This project came from my internship.

                <b>Problem: branches have different ways of doing inventory which makes it difficult to address issues
                    in reported inventory numbers.
                </b>
            </p>

            <p>
                To begin this project, I recruited seven managers to be in my pilot group: two were in California and
                the rest were in Illinois, Georgia, Texas, Lousiana, and Virginia. Before diving into design, I spent
                a day interviewing the group to learn about their current practices when it came to doing inventory.
                The interview was conducted over the phone.
            </p>


            <p>
                The types of questions asked revolved around the themes of organization, process, and tools.
                Some of these questions were:
            </p>

            <div class="imagegallery">
                <img src="Images/TVM/questions.png"/>
            </div>
            <!--<p style="text-align: center;">
                <i><b>
                "Describe your method of organization in the warehouse."<br>
                "Could you please describe the steps that you take to do inventory?"<br>
                "Could you please tell me about what you use to perform inventory counts?"<br>
                "Tell me about a time that you were frustrated while doing inventory counts."
                </b></i>
            </p>-->

            <p>Here is some of what I learned:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Larger branches had come up with 'shortcuts' to speed up inventory counts</li>
                <li>One of the managers had created a macro-enabled spreadsheet that identifies missing inventory</li>
                <li>86% of the group was doing inventory using pencil and paper</li>
                <li>Two of the managers weren't too comfortable with technology</li>
                <li>All branches had inventory organized based on item type</li>
                <li>Smaller branches took about 20-30 mins to do inventory; larger branches took 45min-1hr+</li>
                <li>Branches once used inventory tracking software - now very outdated, did not upgrade because not
                    cost effective</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                After the call, I spent another day organizing my data to present to my supervisor.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>
                    Hypothesis: the inventory app will accomodate all branches regardless of size by cutting down
                    the time it takes branches to count their stock.
                </b>
            </p>

            <p>
                My supervisor had agreed that we had a good case to pursue her idea and develop the app.
                As an addition to the new process, she decided to include the manager's macro-enabled
                Excel file (TVM audit) as another tool to be used. The audit worked using two files: an Excel download
                from the company's system which included all inventory owned by a branch and an Excel file produced by
                the app containing the scanned items present in the warehouse. The audit then checked both files and
                highlighted items that weren't present in either list which meant they could be missing.
            </p>

            <p>
                The revamped count process is shown below:
            </p>

                <img class="smaller" src="Images/TVM/process.png"/>
            </div>

            <p>
                My next step was to begin drafting the app's structure.
            </p>
        </div>

<!--INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE-->
<div id="architecture">
    <div class="text">
        <div class="wrapper">
            <h1>information architecture</h1>
            <p>I created a user flow to show the paths that users would take to complete the main task of scanning
                inventory and exporting the spreadsheet.
            </p>
            <p>
                Below is my brainstorm session for the app's structure:
            </p>
            <!--MAKE THE IMAGE BELOW A PNG FILE-->
            <div class="imagegallery">
                <img src="Images/TVM/flowbrainstorm.PNG"/>
            </div>
            <p>
                Below is an app flow diagram:
            </p>
            <div class="imagegallery">
                <img src="Images/TVM/flowdiagram.png"/>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<!--DESIGN-->
<div id="design">
    <div class="text2">
        <div class="wrapper">
            <h1>design</h1>
            <p>
                After having my diagrams approved, I proceeded to design the interface.
            </p>

            <p>
                The following rough sketches were for me to begin visualizing the interface:
            </p>

            <div class="imagegallery">
                <img src="Images/TVM/handsketch1.png"/>
                <img src="Images/TVM/handsketch2.png"/>
            </div>

            <p>
                Since I am not a visual designer, I used elements of Material Design and followed it as a guideline. All
                branch managers and warehouse workers were given an Android company phone so I felt it was appropriate
                to design the app using Material Design.
            </p>

            <div class="imagegallery">
                <img class="smaller" src="Images/TVM/1.png"/>
                <img class="smaller" src="Images/TVM/2.png"/>
                <img class="smaller" src="Images/TVM/3.png"/>
                <img class="smaller" src="Images/TVM/4.png"/>
                <img class="smaller" src="Images/TVM/5.png"/>
                <img class="smaller" src="Images/TVM/6.png"/>
                <img class="smaller" src="Images/TVM/7.png"/>
                <img class="smaller" src="Images/TVM/8.png"/>
            </div>

            <p>
                I made a change during this phase by including a 'continuous scan' feature that
                allowed managers to scan items with the same tag/item number so that they wouldn't have to type it
                in for each scan.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<!--DEVELOPMENT-->
<div id="develop">

            <h1>development</h1>
            <p>
                I worked with another IT Intern who was comfortable with app development.
                Since he was working in LA and I in Huntington Beach, we would meet once a week so that I could check
                in with him. Together, we'd go over his work to make sure that it was reflective of the requirements
                I had given him.
            </p>

            <p>
                It took about three weeks for him to finish the first prototype of the app. After getting approval
                from our supervisors, I proceeded to test it with my pilot group.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<!--TESTING-->
<div id="testing">
    <div class="text2">
        <div class="wrapper">
            <h1>testing</h1>
            <p>
                I ordered several bluetooth barcode scanners to be paired up with the Samsung
                phones and to be used with the app.
            </p>

            <p>
                The tasks for testing were very simple:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>Download the inventory list from the company system</li>
                <li>Scan 20 items from the warehouse</li>
                <li>Export the spreadsheet from the app</li>
                <li>Upload the files from steps 1 and 2 to the audit file and run the macro</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                Since I wasn't able to oversee testing, I had to conduct these tests remotely by handing
                over the instructions and tools and waiting a week to hear back from the managers. It wasn't the best way
                to do testing, but it was the only way.
            </p>

            <p> I conducted another group call to learn about their thoughts
                and suggestions for improvement. One of the
                requested changes was that the 'Back' button be moved towards the bottom of the screen because it felt
                odd to have it towards the top. I agreed that it was awkwardly placed and later realized that by having
                it towards the bottom, the manager could use their thumb (while holding their phone in one hand) to
                go back.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<!--REFLECTION-->
<div id="reflection">
    <div class="text2">
        <div class="wrapper">
            <h1>reflection</h1>
            <p>
                I was happy to learn that the app was received positively among the group. Unfortunately, because of the
                priority of other projects, I was unable to pursue the launch of this new process among other branches.
                It did feel amazing, however, to know that the branches I had worked with during the study decided to
                continue using the new process.
            </p>

            <p>
                I would have changed two things about this project. First, I would have liked to have worked with the
                other IT intern from the start because I think he would have felt more comfortable working with me
                and he might have felt more ownership of the project rather than it just being a handoff.
            </p>

            <p>
                Second, I would have liked to conduct the testing in person to observe the managers as they used the
                app and determine if it fit well within the inventory process. I feel like opportunities for insight
                were lost in having done testing the way we did, but I understand that sometimes situations are not
                ideal and that's ok. It's about making the best out of what has been given.
            </p>

            <p>
                I'm very grateful for this experience because it made me confirm my desire to enter the UX field. It's
                very fulfilling to know that my efforts made someone's job easier and more enjoyable.
