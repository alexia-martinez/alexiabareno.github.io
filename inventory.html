            <h2>01 Background</h2>
            <p>
                Barcode Scanner is a mobile application that creates an exportable spreadsheet containing scanned
                warehouse inventory items. It was designed to improve the inventory process by simplifying
                the inventory count. I followed a user centered design approach by conducting
                user research, flow diagrams, sketching/wireframing, development, and testing, all while iterating
                where necessary.
            </p>

            <p id="disclaimer">
                <b>This project was part of my internship experience and in compliance with my non-disclosure agreement,
                    I have omitted confidential information.
                </b>
            </p>

            <h3>How Does Barcode Scanner Work?</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>After starting a spreadsheet, the user enters the item number and zone tag ID.</li>
                <li>Using a Bluetooth barcode scanner paired with their Android phone, the user scans barcodes.</li>
                <li>After scanning, managers export the spreadsheet for use in the next step of their inventory count
                process.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Team & Roles</h3>
            <p>
                I worked with another IT Intern who developed the app. My role was that of UX Designer, so I conducted
                user research and interviews, created flows, sketches, UI designs, and usability testing.

            <h2>02 Research</h2>
            <p>
                My task was to design an app that would establish a more streamlined way of counting inventory,
                essentially establishing a common procedure for all branches. The first step was to learn more
                about my users and ask <i>how</i> they were currently counting inventory and <i>why</i>.
            </p>

            <h3>User Interviews</h3>
            <ul class="bullet">
                <li><b>Who?</b> I recruited seven managers to be in my pilot group. The managers were located in
                California, Texas, Illinois, Georgia, Louisiana, and Virginia.</li>
                <li>
                    <b>What?</b> I wanted to learn more about my users and understand <i>what</i> their methods for
                    counting inventory were and <i>why</i>. I asked questions on the themes of organization, process,
                    and tools.
                    <ul class="bullet2">
                        <li>Describe your method of organizaton in the warehouse.</li>
                        <li>Could you please describe the steps you take to do inventory?</li>
                        <li>Could you please tell me what you use to perform inventory counts?</li>
                        <li>Tell me about a time that you were frustrated while doing inventory. What was the problem?</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>Where?</b> One interview was done in person since the warehouse was on-site. The rest were done
                over the phone.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Interview Findings</h3>
            <p>In summary, my supervisor and I decided that pursuing the idea of an inventory app would accommodate all
            branches regardless of size by reducing the amount of effort and time to count their stock.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Larger branches had come up with 'shortcuts' to speed up inventory counts</li>
                <li>All branches had inventory organized based on item type</li>
                <li>Smaller branches took about 20-30 mins to do inventory; larger branches took 45min-1hr+</li>
                <li>Branches once used an inventory tracking software but abandoned it because it became outdated</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Sketches</h3>
            <p>
                The following rough sketches helped me begin visualizing the interface:
            </p>

            <div class="imagegallery">
                <img src="Images/TVM/handsketch1.png"/>
                <img src="Images/TVM/handsketch2.png"/>
            </div>

            <h3>UI Mockups</h3>
            <p>
                I am not a visual designer, so I used elements of Material Design and followed it as a guideline. All
                branch managers and warehouse workers were given an Android company phone so I felt it was appropriate
                to design the app using Material Design.
            </p>

            <p>
                Below are some key screens from the app.
            </p>

            <!--HOME-->
            <div class="exception2 wrapper keyscreen">
                <img class="border" src= "Images/TVM/images/image6.png">
            </div>
            <div class="exception2 wrapper">
                <h4>Home</h4>
                <p>
                    Upon opening the app, the managers see all created spreadsheets and have the options of opening
                    a spreadsheet, deleting a spreadsheet, creating a new spreadsheet, and sending (exporting) a
                    spreadsheet.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!--NEW SPREADSHEET-->
            <div class="exception2 wrapper keyscreen">
                <img class="border" src= "Images/TVM/images/image4.png">
            </div>
            <div class="exception2 wrapper">
                <h4>New Spreadsheet</h4>
                <p>
                    One of the requested features was to make it possible for managers to enter item numbers (which
                    specify item type) and zone tags (which specify the warehouse location of an item.) Other
                    barcode scanning apps required managers to input this information every time they scanned a barcode,
                    but I added two fields for managers to specify this information once. With every scan,
                    the app will continuously add the item number and zone tag until the manager clears the fields or
                    changes them.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!--SENDING SPREADSHEET-->
            <div class="exception2 wrapper keyscreen">
                <img class="border" src= "Images/TVM/images/image2.png">
            </div>
            <div class="exception2 wrapper">
                <h4>Sending a Spreadsheet</h4>
                <p>
                    Managers are given options on how they would like to export their spreadsheet. Most preferred
                    the email method but we gave them a variety of options.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>Development</h3>
            <p>
                I worked with another IT Intern who was comfortable with app development.
                Since he was working in LA and I in Huntington Beach, we would meet once a week so that I could check
                in with him. Together, we'd go over his work to make sure that it was reflective of the requirements
                I had given him.
            </p>

            <p>
                It took about three weeks for him to finish the first prototype of the app. After getting approval
                from our supervisors, I proceeded to test it with my pilot group.
            </p>

            <h3>Testing</h3>
            <p>
                The tasks for testing were very simple:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>Download the inventory list from the company system</li>
                <li>Scan 20 items from the warehouse</li>
                <li>Export the spreadsheet from the app</li>
                <li>Upload the files from steps 1 and 2 to the audit file and run the macro</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                Since I wasn't able to oversee testing, I had to conduct these tests remotely by handing
                over the instructions and tools and waiting a week to hear back from the managers. It wasn't the best way
                to do testing, but it was the only way.
            </p>

            <p> I conducted another group call to learn about their thoughts
                and suggestions for improvement. One of the
                requested changes was that the 'Back' button be moved towards the bottom of the screen because it felt
                odd to have it towards the top. I agreed that it was awkwardly placed and later realized that by having
                it towards the bottom, the manager could use their thumb (while holding their phone in one hand) to
                go back.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<!--REFLECTION-->
<div id="reflection">
    <div class="text2">
        <div class="wrapper">
            <h2>04 Reflection</h2>
            <p>
                I was happy to learn that the app was received positively among the group. Unfortunately, because of the
                priority of other projects, I was unable to pursue the launch of this new process among other branches.
                It did feel amazing, however, to know that the branches I had worked with during the study decided to
                continue using the new process.
            </p>

            <p>
                I would have changed two things about this project. First, I would have liked to have worked with the
                other IT intern from the start because I think he would have felt more comfortable working with me
                and he might have felt more ownership of the project rather than it just being a handoff.
            </p>

            <p>
                Second, I would have liked to conduct the testing in person to observe the managers as they used the
                app and determine if it fit well within the inventory process. I feel like opportunities for insight
                were lost in having done testing the way we did, but I understand that sometimes situations are not
                ideal and that's ok. It's about making the best out of what has been given.
            </p>

            <p>
                I'm very grateful for this experience because it made me confirm my desire to enter the UX field. It's
                very fulfilling to know that my efforts made someone's job easier and more enjoyable.
            </p>
