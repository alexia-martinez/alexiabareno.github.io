<!-- ABOUT -->
<div id="about">

            <h2 id="greeting">01 Background</h2>
            <p>
                Shouts is an app that helps UCI students find their ideal study spots on campus. A student could
                either manually search for a spot (ex: Starbucks, library, etc.) or have the app suggest one
                based on proximity. Each location has a noise-level rating (ex: quiet, very loud) which is reported by
                students who are currently at that spot.
            </p>

            <h3>How Does Shouts Work?</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>A student opens the app and may either have a location suggested based on proximity or manually
                    search for one.</li>
                <li><b>If they choose to have a location found for them</b>, they will be given a list of locations
                nearby with their noise-level ratings.
                <li><b>If they choose to search for a location themselves,</b> they type in the name of a location
                and will be shown a list of all locations with that name sorted from near to far. Noise-level ratings are
                also shown.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Team & Roles</h3>
            <p>
                I worked on this project with three peers from my Human-Computer Interaction class at UC Irvine. Together,
                we conducted research, sketches, and testing. I delivered the personas and wireframes.

            <h2>02 Empathize</h2>
            <p>For this project, we followed the Design Thinking method from the Stanford d.school. We were tasked to
            design a solution for the following problem:</p>

            <p style="text-align: center">
                <b>
                    How can we increase student productivity when it comes to studying?
                </b>
            </p>

            <p>
                To begin, my team and I:
            </p>

            <ul class="bullet">
                <li>Conducted user research on campus at libraries, Starbucks, and outdoor areas</li>
                <li>Organized our data into an affinity diagram with four categories: Procrastination and Distractions,
                    Study Environment, Work Environment, and Productivity Booster</li>
                <li>Put together an empathy map to ground our design on a deep understanding of who our solution
                    is for</li>
                <li>Formed two personas that embody potential users of our app</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The steps above were taken to understand our user within the context of our design problem.
                Below are our UX deliverables: an affinity diagram, an empathy map, and my two personas.
            </p>

<!--DEFINE & IDEATE-->

            <h2>03 Define & Ideate</h2>
            <p>
                We found that the underlying issues related to ineffective studying were space availability and noise
                levels. The data collected told of students having trouble finding open spaces to use and having to
                study at locations that weren't suitable for them.
            </p>

            <p>
                We proceeded to brainstorm possible solutions to our problem. There were no limits, every idea was
                considered.
            </p>

            <div class="imagegallery">
                <img src="Images/SHOUTS/Brainstorm.png"/>
            </div>

            <p>
                We concluded that our solution must assist students in quickly finding their ideal study space so that
                they don't waste time searching across campus.

<!--PROTOTYPE & TEST-->
<div id="prototype">
    <div class="text2">
        <div class="wrapper">
            <h2>04 Prototype & Test</h2>
            <p>
                We designed an app that determines the noise level of a location, thus accommodating students with their
                preferred study environment.
            </p>

            <p>
                We created and tested a lo-fi prototype of our app with cognitive walk-throughs, a Heuristic Evaluation,
                and think-alouds with UCI students. We asked them for feedback about the accessibility and layout of
                the content. Here are the responses:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>There is no availability of a map for free searching without doing a keyword entry</li>
                <li>There is no back button that allows the user to return to the 'Search' page</li>
                <li>The consistent and minimalist design allows for easy navigation of the app</li>
                <li>The user has limited control and freedom in the app (they need more options to filter study
                    centers)</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Paper Prototype</h3>

                <img src="Images/SHOUTS/3.png"/>
            </div>

            <h3>Wireframes</h3>
            <p>
                The delivery of the lo-fi prototypes marked the end of the project, but I decided to create wireframes
                using Axure as shown below.
            </p>

<!--REFLECTION-->

    <div class="text">
        <div class="wrapper">
            <h2>05 Reflection</h2>
            <p>
                This was my first time doing UX work and I loved every minute of it. Empathizing with others and
                understanding their issues was something that I'd never done before in a project, and I felt very
                comfortable doing it. It was a very gratifying experience, getting to collaborate with my team to creatively
                solve a problem shared by many. I learned that I'm empathetic and curious which I felt were traits
                that helped me succeed.
            </p>

            <p>
                Although I was happy with the outcome, I would make a few changes to the overall project. First,
                I would research what options students would like to filter locations by and update the
                wireframes to test with users. Second, I would have liked to create an interactive prototype using
                InVision or Adobe XD and test it with our users. Perhaps a more realistic representation of our app
                would have elicited more insightful feedback.
