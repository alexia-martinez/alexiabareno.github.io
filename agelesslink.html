            <h2>01 Background</h2>
            <p>Ageless Link is a web portal for
                <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://agelessalliance.org/">Ageless Alliance</a> volunteers and
                administrators. It gives volunteers onboarding support, notifies them on which elder they
                will be assisting, and allows them to log their service hours. The administrator is provided a dashboard showing
                volunteer activity across the organization. Ageless Link also allows visitors to refer an elder to the
                Ageless Alliance program.
            </p>

            <h3>How Does Ageless Link Work?</h3>
            <p><b>For a volunteer:</b></p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    After signing up, the user completes a checklist of items to become an Ageless Link volunteer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Upon approval, volunteers can log in and request to be paired with an elder.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After visiting/calling an elder, the volunteer can log in their hours online.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p><b>For an admin:</b></p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    After log in, the admin sees a dashboard showing total service hours, new applications,
                    volunteer-elder pairings, hibernating volunteers, and more.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Team & Roles</h3>
            <p>
                I worked on this project with three peers from my Senior Design class at UC Irvine. We conducted user
                interviews, wireframing, and web development together. My role was client interaction and sketching.

            <h2>02 Research</h2>
            <p>
                To design a solution that improved the volunteer and admin experience, we had to find out <i>what</i>
                the issues were for both groups and <i>why</i>. Here is a summary of our research findings:
            </p>

            <ul class="bullet">
                <li>It was <b>hard to keep track</b> of all volunteer-elder matches as they were <b>manually done</b></li>
                <li>There was <b>no visibility</b> into volunteer activity for the admins</li>
                <li>Volunteers did not always log in hours because they had to do so <b>in person</b></li>
                <li>Volunteers only knew who and when to visit after <b>receiving a call from a lead member</b></li>
                <li>Volunteers weren't always able to drive out to visit the elder &mdash; which made elders feel <b>sad and
                alone</b> &mdash; because they <b>found out last minute</b>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>User Interviews</h3>
            <h4>VOLUNTEERS</h4>
            <div class="imagegallery">
                <img src="Images/AGELESS/ageless%20link%20personas.png"/>
            </div>

            <h4>Key Insights & Opportunities</h4>
            <p><b>How might we...</b> make it easy for volunteers to log in hours?</p>
            <ul class="bullet">
                <li>Volunteers have other responsibilities and driving to the office to log hours can be inconvenient.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>How might we...</b> let volunteers know who to contact for assistance?</p>
            <ul class="bullet">
                <li>Depending on the situation, volunteers may need to call or message. Establishing a 'help' center
                    can direct volunteers to the right people.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>How might we...</b> inform volunteers of their duties as a volunteer?</p>
            <ul class="bullet">
                <li>Volunteers are given a short guide to what's expected of them, but establishing a comprehensive
                    online guide may help both to inform the volunteer and to reduce paper use.</li>
            </ul>

            </div>

            <h4>Key Insights & Opportunities</h4>
            <p><b>How might we...</b> assist the admin in matching and tracking volunteer-elder pairs?</p>
            <ul class="bullet">
                <li>If we can automatically pair volunteers with elders, we can help the administrator devote her
                    time to other important tasks.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>How might we...</b> simplify the process of processing volunteer applications?</p>
            <ul class="bullet">
                <li>Applying online would rid of paper applications and make it easier to keep track of which ones
                    need to be processed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>How might we...</b> give the admin visibility into volunteer activity?</p>
            <ul class="bullet">
                <li>If we can notify the admin about new applicants, hibernating volunteers, active volunteers, etc. then
                    we can make it less stressful for leadership to run the organization because they would know where
                they need to direct their attention to.</li>

            <h2>03 Planning</h2>
            <p>After conducting our research, we knew to deliver a solution that would streamline the volunteer experience
            and also deliver the admin insight into member activities.</p>

            <h3>Sketches</h3>
            <p>
                I created the following sketches to outline the volunteers' interaction with the website. These
                led to more discussions about what we wanted the volunteer to be able to do.
            </p>

                <img src="Images/AGELESS/FIRSTGEN/AgelessConnectSitemap.png"/>
            </div>

            <h3>Wireframes</h3>
            <p>
                My team and I proceeded to create wireframes using Axure. Following approval from our partner,
                two of our team members met with five volunteers to test them for feedback.
            </p>

            <h4>Volunteer Portal</h4>

            </div>

            <p>
                Our partner and the volunteers were pleased and some minor changes were requested. We then moved on
                to build our prototype.
            </p>

            <h3>Prototype</h3>
            <p>
                Our <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://ageless-link.firebaseapp.com/">prototype</a> was
                created using Bootstrap and open source code. We used Firebase as our database manager to store all
                account information and handle our elder-volunteer matching. I've included screenshots of the volunteer
                account below.
            </p>

            <p>
                Below is an outline of what we had planned our admin page to look like upon log in. The dashboard is
                designed so that the admin has more visibility into volunteer activity such as most recent logs entered,
                hibernating volunteers, volunteer-elder matches, and more. Due to time constraints, we were unable to
                finish this portion of our prototype.

            <p>
                Part of our project involved a four minute final presentation during the showcase event. I’ve included a
                few images of our poster and the event below.

            <p>
                The biggest challenge was identifying the problem because our client had a difficult time explaining
                what she needed and what she expected of us. She wasn't too familiar with what was feasible, so as a team
                we had to step in and take direction with our solution. This project taught me that research is
                imperative to projects like this because in taking the time to investigate the problem, we identified
                other underlying issues that could have otherwise gone unnoticed.
            </p>

            <p>
                This course did not have any 'rules' to follow and there were no specific assignments to turn in
                except for documentation. Apporaching this project with the design thinking method helped us stay
                on track and focused on our users. If we only relied on the information our clients shared with us
                without checking in with our users, we most likely would have delivered a product that missed the
                mark. Also, it was wonderful to know that our clients were very pleased with how it turned out.
