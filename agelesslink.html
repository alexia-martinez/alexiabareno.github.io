<!-- ABOUT -->
<div id="about">
    <div class="text">
        <div class="wrapper">
            <h1 id="greeting">ageless link;</h1>
            <p>Ageless Link, in partnership with
                <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://agelessalliance.org/">Ageless Alliance</a>,
                is a nonprofit web solution that bridges volunteers with isolated elders in Orange County as a
                prevention for elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation. This project came from my senior design course
                at UC Irvine.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our solution pairs volunteers with elders, allows volunteers to record their service hours, and gives
                the administrator access to a dashboard that provides an overview of volunteer activity which includes
                logged service hours, new volunteer applications, and volunteer-elder matches.
            </p>

            <p><b>Role:</b> As a UX Designer, I conducted user research, produced sketches and wireframes using Axure,
                and helped with web development (Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS.)
            </p>

<!--PROBLEM-->
<div id="problem">
    <div class="text2">
        <div class="wrapper">
            <h1>what's the problem?</h1>
            <p>
                The founder of Ageless Alliance initially asked for a creative software solution (computer and phone
                use) that collects information from elders and volunteers. I felt that we did not have enough
                information to understand what was being asked of us &mdash; was there a current method of collecting
                information that didn't work? What about it wasn't working? A peer and I decided to meet with the
                founder and ask her questions to learn more about her organization and to identify the problem(s).
            </p>

            <p>
                Our research on Ageless Alliance began with interviewing the founder and the social media manager/admin.
                They explained the mission of the organization and its involvement with the elderly community. We
                learned that the organization's most valuable resource was its volunteer group which devotes
                time to assist elders with everyday tasks and most importantly, keeps the elders company by visiting
                their homes every so often. We asked our clients about the challenges they were facing in managing the
                organization and discovered that managing volunteer groups and member information was the problem.
                We learned that:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>It was hard to keep track of all elder-volunteer matches as they were manually done</li>
                <li>There was no visibility into volunteer activity and the volunteers did not always log in hours so
                    the organization assumed they didn't visit the elder</li>
                <li>The volunteers only knew who and when to visit after receiving a call from a lead member</li>
                <li>The volunteers weren't always able to drive out to visit the elder which made some elders feel
                    sad</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                We understood that the founder wanted an improved way to match elders with volunteers (these matches
                are the 'information' she was referring to in her initial request), but that she really needed a better
                way to direct and track volunteer activity. The problem then became clear: <b>How can we create and
                track volunteer-elder matches?</b>
            </p>

            <p>
                After discussion, my team and our partner agreed that a website (portal) would benefit the organization
                greatly. Volunteers would use it to log in their hours and to see who they had been matched with. They
                would also be able to log their hours on the go via their mobile device. The administrator(s) would
                access a dashboard of volunteer activity. Our clients also asked to make available information about the
                organization and about how to become a volunteer.
            </p>

            <p>
                Prior to beginning the design of our website, I did a competitive analysis of three similar sites to become
                aware of what other sites had content-wise and to see what worked and what didn't.
            </p>

<!-- USERS -->
<div id="users">
    <div class="text">
        <div class="wrapper">
            <h1>meeting our users</h1>
            <p>
                Now that we had a clear view of our problem, the next step was to gain a clear understanding of our
                users: the volunteers and the administrator(s). We did not include elders for two reasons: (a) although
                many elders are technologically savvy, not all are and we did not want to risk the possibility of
                excluding some of our elders from being a part of this program, and (b) all relevant elder information
                is already held by the organization, so there's no need for an elder to have an account.
            </p>

            <p>
                I helped conduct interviews with 5 volunteers to learn more about the volunteer role and to identify
                any pain points that might be present in the volunteer routine. Our volunteers were men and women of
                ages 40-54 who felt comfortable using the internet, computers, and mobile devices.
            </p>

            <h3>volunteers</h3>
            <div class="imagegallery">

            </div>

            <h3>key insights and opportunities</h3>
            <p><b>VOLUNTEERS</b></p>
            <p><b>How might we...</b> make it easy for volunteers to log in hours?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Volunteers have other responsibilities and driving to the office to log hours can be inconvenient</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>How might we...</b> let volunteers know who to contact for assistance?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Depending on the situation, volunteers may need to call or message. Establishing a 'help' center
                    can direct volunteers to the right people</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>How might we...</b> inform volunteers of their duties as a volunteer?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Volunteers are given a short guide to what's expected of them, but establishing a comprehensive
                    online guide may help both to inform the volunteer and to reduce paper use</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>administrator</h3>

            </div>

            <h3>key insights and opportunities</h3>
            <p><b>ADMINISTRATOR</b></p>
            <p><b>How might we...</b> assist the admin in matching and tracking volunteer-elder pairs?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If we can automatically pair volunteers with elders, we can help the administrator devote her
                    time to other important tasks</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>How might we...</b> simplify the process of processing volunteer applications?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Applying online would rid of paper applications and make it easier to keep track of which ones
                    need to be processed</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>How might we...</b> give the admin visibility into volunteer activity?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If we can notify the admin about new applicants, hibernating volunteers, active volunteers, etc. then
                    we can make it less stressful for leadership to run the organization</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                I created the following sketches to show how our volunteers would be navigating the website. These
                led to more discussions about what we wanted the volunteer to be able to do.
            </p>

            </div>

            <p>
                I proceeded to help create mockups &mdash; seen below. Following approval from our partner,
                two of our team members met with 5 volunteers to test them for feedback. These were done using Axure.
            </p>

            <h3>volunteer portal</h3>

            <p>
                Our partner and the volunteers were pleased and some minor changes were asked of us. We then moved on
                to build our prototype.
            </p>

                Our <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://ageless-link.firebaseapp.com/">prototype</a> was
                created using Bootstrap and open source code. We used Firebase as our database manager to store all
                account information and handle our elder-volunteer matching. I've included screenshots of the volunteer
                account below.
            </p>

            <h3>volunteer portal</h3>
            <div class="imagegallery">

            <p>
                Below is an outline of what we had planned our admin page to look like upon log in. The dashboard is
                designed so that the admin has more visibility into volunteer activity such as most recent logs entered,
                hibernating volunteers, elder-volunteer matches, and more. Due to time constraints, we were unable to
                finish this portion of our prototype.
            </p>

                The biggest challenge was identifying the problem because our client had a difficult time explaining
                what she needed to be done. This project taught me that research is imperative to projects like this
                because in taking the time to investigate the problem, we identified other underlying issues that could
                have otherwise gone unnoticed.
            </p>

            <p>
                This course did not have any 'rules' to follow and there were no specific assignments to turn in
                except for documentation. Apporaching this project with the design thinking method helped us stay
                on track and focused on our users. If we only relied on the information our clients shared with us
                without checking in with our users, we most likely would have delivered a useless product.
