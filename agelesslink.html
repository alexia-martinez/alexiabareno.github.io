<!-- ABOUT -->
<div id="about">
    <div class="text">
        <div class="wrapper">
            <h1 id="greeting">ageless link;</h1>
            <p>Ageless Link, in partnership with
                <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://agelessalliance.org/">Ageless Alliance</a>,
                is a nonprofit website solution that bridges volunteers with isolated elders in Orange County as a
                prevention for elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation. This project came from my senior design course
                at UC Irvine.
            </p>

            <p>Our solution pairs volunteers with elders, allows volunteers to record their service hours, and gives
                the administrator access to a dashboard that provides an overview of volunteer activity which includes
                logged service hours, new volunteer applications, and volunteer-elder matches.
            </p>

            <p><b>Role:</b> As a UX Designer, I conducted user research, produced sketches and wireframes using Axure,
                and helped with web development (Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS.)
            </p>

<!--PROBLEM-->
<div id="problem">
    <div class="text2">
        <div class="wrapper">
            <h1>what's the problem?</h1>
            <p>
                The founder of Ageless Alliance initially asked for a creative software solution (computer and phone
                use) that collects information from elders and from volunteers. I felt that this was a very vague
                request &mdash; was there a current method of collecting information that didn't work? What about it
                wasn't working? A peer and I decided to meet with the founder and ask her questions to learn more
                about her organization and to identify the problem(s).
            </p>

            <p>
                Our research on Ageless Alliance began with interviewing the founder and the social media manager/admin.
                They explained the mission of the organization and their current involvement with the elderly
                community. We learned that the organization's most valuable resource was its volunteer group which devotes
                time to assist elders with everyday tasks and most importantly, to keep elders company during certain days
                of the week. We asked about the challenges they were facing in managing the organization and discovered
                that these were in managing volunteer groups and member information. We learned that:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>It was hard to keep track of all elder-volunteer matches as they were manually done</li>
                <li>There was no visibility into volunteer activity and the volunteers did not always log in hours so
                    the organization assumed they didn't visit the elder</li>
                <li>The volunteers only knew who and when to visit after receiving a call from a lead member</li>
                <li>The volunteers weren't always able to drive out to visit the elder which made some elders feel
                    sad</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                We learned that the founder wanted an improved way to match elders with volunteers (these matches
                are the 'information' she was referring to in her initial request), but that she really needed a better
                way to direct and track volunteer activity. The problem then became clear: <b>How can we create and
                track volunteer-elder matches?</b>
            </p>

            <p>
                After discussion, my team and our partner agreed that a website (portal) would benefit the organization
                greatly. Volunteers would use it to log in their hours and to see who they had been matched with. They
                would also be able to log their hours on the go via their mobile device. The administrator(s) would
                access a dashboard of volunteer activity. Since it was to be a website, it was important that we
                also include information about the organization and how to become a volunteer.
            </p>

            <p>
                Prior to beginning the design of our website, I did a competitive analysis of similar sites to become
                aware of what other sites had content-wise and to see what worked and what didn't. I looked at three
                organizations: Elder Helpers, Caregivers, and Life Elder Care. Below is one of them:
            </p>

            <h3>caregivers</h3>
            <p><b>Purpose:</b> to explain the organization's purpose and the services it offers, to show how to get
                involved</p>
            <p><b>Content summary:</b> about Caregivers, volunteer information, donations, videos of volunteers
                helping elders, calendar of upcoming events</p>
            <p><b>Notable features:</b> homepage has a slideshow featuring photos of volunteers and elders, links to
                most important areas of site (about, volunteer, elder feedback, donate)</p>
            <p><b>Visual styling strength(s):</b> relatively neutral color scheme, simple page design</p>
            <p><b>Overall weaknesses:</b> some lack of information structure as content is scattered throughout pages,
                overwhelming amount of content in some pages, two navigation bars</p>
            <p><b>Analysis:</b> The website provides all necessary information to properly inform its visitors, however,
                the content structure undermines its effort to inform.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

<!-- USERS -->
<div id="users">
    <div class="text">
        <div class="wrapper">
            <h1>meeting our users</h1>
            <p>
                Now that we had a clear view of our problem, the next step was to gain a clear understanding of our
                users: the volunteers and the administrator(s). We did not include elders for two reasons: (a) although
                many elders are technologically savvy, not all are and we did not want to risk the possibility of
                excluding some of our elders from being a part of this program, and (b) all relevant elder information
                is already held by the organization, so there's no need for an elder to have an account.
            </p>

            <p>
                I helped conduct interviews with 5 volunteers to learn more about what it's like to be a volunteer and
                to identify pain points in the volunteer routine. Our volunteers were men and women of ages 40-54
                who felt comfortable using the internet, computers, and mobile devices.
            </p>

            <h3>volunteers</h3>
            <div class="imagegallery">
                <img src="Images/AGELESS/ageless%20link%20personas.png"/>
            </div>

            <h3>key insights and opportunities</h3>
            <p><b>VOLUNTEERS</b></p>
            <p><b>How might we...</b> make it easy for volunteers to log in hours?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Volunteers have other responsibilities and driving to the office to log hours can be inconvenient</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>How might we...</b> let volunteers know who to contact for assistance?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Depending on the situation, volunteers may need to call or message. Establishing a 'help' center
                    can direct volunteers to the right people</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>How might we...</b> inform volunteers of their duties as a volunteer?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Volunteers are given a short guide to what's expected of them, but establishing a comprehensive
                    online guide may help both to inform the volunteer and to reduce paper use</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>administrator</h3>
            <div class="imagegallery">
                <img src="Images/AGELESS/AL%20admin%20persona.png"/>
            </div>

            <h3>key insights and opportunities</h3>
            <p><b>ADMINISTRATOR</b></p>
            <p><b>How might we...</b> assist the admin in matching and tracking volunteer-elder pairs?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If we can automatically pair volunteers with elders, we can help the administrator devote her
                    time to other important tasks</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>How might we...</b> simplify the process of processing volunteer applications?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Applying online would rid of paper applications and make it easier to keep track of which ones
                    need to be processed</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>How might we...</b> give the admin visibility into volunteer activity?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If we can notify the admin about new applicants, hibernating volunteers, active volunteers, etc. then
                    we can make it less stressful for leadership to run the organization</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>drafting the solution</h1>
            <p>
                I created the following sketches to show how our volunteers would be navigating the website. These
                led to more discussions about what we wanted the volunteer to be able to do.
            </p>

            <div class="imagegallery">
                <img src="Images/AGELESS/FIRSTGEN/AgelessConnectSitemap.png"/>
            </div>

            <p>
                I proceeded to help create wireframes &mdash; seen below. Following approval from our partner,
                two of our team members met with 5 volunteers to test them for feedback. These interactive wireframes
                were done using Axure.
            </p>

            <h3>volunteer portal</h3>
            <div class="imagegallery">

            </div>

            <p>
                Our partner and the volunteers were pleased &mdash; we were VERY lucky that no changes were proposed. We
                then moved on to build our prototype.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<!--PROTOTYPE-->
<div id="prototype">
    <div class="text2">
        <div class="wrapper">
            <h1>prototype</h1>
            <p>
                Our <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://ageless-link.firebaseapp.com/">prototype</a> was
                created using Bootstrap and open source code. We used Firebase as our database manager to store all
                account information and handle our elder-volunteer matching. I've included screenshots of the volunteer
                account below.
            </p>

            <h3>volunteer portal</h3>
            <div class="imagegallery">

            <p>
                Below is an outline of what we had planned our admin page to look like upon log in. The dashboard is
                designed so that the admin has more visibility into volunteer activity such as most recent logs entered,
                hibernating volunteers, elder-volunteer matches, and more. Due to time constraints, we were unable to
                finish this portion of our prototype.

                The biggest challenge was figuring out how to start because our partner wasn't too sure of what she was
                looking for. This project taught me that research is imperative to projects like this because not only
                do we learn about the organization, the client, and the users, but we also unearth needs that the
                client may not have been aware of.
            </p>

            <p>
                Another challenge was that of web development. Before this, I had done a little bit in HTML and CSS,
                but I never actually put something significant together. It was a big learning opportunity for me.
            </p>

            <p>
                My takeaway from this experience is: we can't proceed with assumptions in design. If a UI mockup isn't
                in line with what users require, then it's just a UI mockup. It's not a solution. I learned to always
                ask questions if I'm feeling unsure. I also learned that checking in with the client (and/or users) to
                validate progress helps avoid major issues that would require valuable time and resources to fix later
                on.
