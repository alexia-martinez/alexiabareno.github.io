                Bark+Play helps owners socialize their dogs by finding play dates for them. It also
                encourages people to build stronger interpersonal relationships with others in their community.
            </p>

            <p>
                This is a personal project inspired by my experience with socializing my dog and my interactions with
                members of my community.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Role:</b> As a UX Designer, I conducted interviews to understand the problem and users, did
                some competitive analysis, developed personas, brainstormed potential solutions, mapped the task
                flow, developed a brand, and created UI mockups.

<!--PROBLEM-->
<div id="problem">
    <div class="text2">
        <div class="wrapper">
            <h1>the initial problem</h1>
            <p>
                Socializing a dog is an important responsibility as an owner. A lack of socialization may lead dogs to
                become defensive at the sight of other dogs. Like us, dogs learn through experience and allowing them to
                experience the world is the best way to teach them how to behave properly. <b>How, though, do we help
                teach dogs who aren’t constantly exposed to other dogs to behave properly?</b>
            </p>

<!--SOCIALIZING-->
<div id="socializing">

            <h1>socializing is hard</h1>
            <div class="imagegallery">
                <img src="Images/BARK+PLAY/personas.png"/>
            </div>

            <p>
                I conducted qualitative interviews with five dog owners (ages 18-24) who enjoy walking their dogs or
                taking them to parks. I wanted to understand how they go about socializing their dogs and what the
                challenges are.
            </p>

            <p>
                I asked them questions about their experiences with walking their dogs, meeting other dog owners, and
                dealing with socialization issues.
            </p>

            <h3>key insights and opportunities</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Because of time, owners tug on their dog's leash to keep them walking rather than stopping to
                    socialize</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <b>How might we...</b> encourage owners to let their dogs interact with others?
            <ul>
                <li>Dogs naturally want to interact with other dogs because they're curious, but we as owners
                    sometimes prevent them from doing so</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>How might we...</b> create/facilitate time for owners to let their dogs interact with other dogs?
            <ul>
                <li>Sometimes, dogs may not come across other dogs on their regular walks which is a lost
                    opportunity</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>How might we...</b> assist owners to form connections with other owners within a neighborhood?
            <ul>
                <li>It can feel odd sometimes to strike up conversations with others during a walk if there is no common
                    ground</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
        </div>

<!--NEW PROBLEM-->
<div id="newproblem">
    <div class="text2">
        <div class="wrapper">
            <h1>the new problem</h1>
            <p>
                After the interviews, I felt that the socialization issue was larger in that it wasn’t just something
                that dogs had to improve on, but also us as members of a community. I believe that we are all attached
                to our phones &mdash; myself included &mdash;
                because most of us use them to access important information like our bank accounts,
                emails, and social media. In relying on our phones to connect to our world, we become detached from our
                physical community. I understand why it’s hard for everyone to disconnect &mdash; I empathize because I
                also struggle &mdash; but our phone doesn’t have to be a problem. It can instead be the medium for
                solving the socialization issue present in our community and subsequently, our dogs.
            </p>
        </div>

<!--COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS-->
<div id="competitive">
    <div class="text2">
        <div class="wrapper">
            <h1>what's out there?</h1>
            <p>
                I brainstormed possible ways to help people form connections within their community with the goal of
                also helping dogs socialize. I didn't limit myself. At this point, any idea was a good one.
            </p>

            <p>
                When reviewing what I had come up with, I realized that some ideas were costly &mdash; a public portal
                that works in conjuction with the city's animal shelter database of registered dogs where registered
                owners can request to meet up with others... pretty messy and pretty costly. Also, the problem with
                this potential solution is that it impinges on the public's choice to participate.
            </p>

            <p>
                Since nearly everyone uses their phone for daily tasks, I decided to design an app that allows owners to
                voluntarily sign up to meet with other owners in the area. Before starting, I did some research to
                see if there were any existing apps and to take note of what I thought they were doing right and what
                they could improve:

            <h3>notable features</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Feedback is simple and informational &mdash; if swipe left (pass) image of dog moves left, if swipe
                    right (accept) and it's a match, the options to send message or keep playing (find someone else)

            <ol>
                <li>App is easily confused with a dating app because it's marketed that way, someone who only wants to
                    socialize with others may not want to use it</li>
                <li>No way for users to look up dogs they've met or liked</li>

                <li>Much of the design and function is taken from Facebook</li>
                <li>GPS continually runs in the background which may drain battery life very quickly</li>
                <li>UI appears a bit complex &mdash; users may focus more on using the app than finding the perfect

                        only uses it when the app has been opened. If GPS isn't used, then only the user's city is

                        adding this feature, I hope to encourage users to form connections with people in their
                        neighborhood and push them to start conversations beyond the screen. Subsequently, through these
                        new formed friendships, the user's dogs will have regular play dates and new friends, which
                        translates to good social skills.

                Regarding the design process, my next step would be to present my design to users so that I may
                determine what can be improved. Only through testing would I be able to learn how well my solution
                satisfies the needs of Bark + Play's potential users.
            </p>

            <p>
                I know that there is always room for improvement, so after testing with users and making necessary
                changes, I would work to develop a prototype to test for screen flow and usability issues. Since I'm
                not a developer, I would want to collaborate with a development team which would be a great opportunity
                to use my product management skills.

                Through this project, I learned how to understand users through empathy and through
                creating a product that facilitates behavioral change and delivers value to its users. I also practiced
                weaving digital and physical experiences into a product that emphasizes building interpersonal
                relationships in a real life setting. Bark + Play's purpose is to encourage users to meet members of their
                community and share their love for dogs while helping their dogs learn to socialize through play dates.
                I would hope that these interactions would generate awareness of diversity and connection within a
                neighborhood.

            <p>
                I'm always looking to improve as a designer and a big part of this process is learning what my strengths
                and weaknesses are. I'm not a visual designer, but this project helped me develop my UI
                design skills concerning color, layout, and typography. I learned that I'm a minimalist when it comes
                to design because to me, a simple UI can help users focus more on the actual experience and content.
