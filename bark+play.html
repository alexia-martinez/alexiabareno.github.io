            <h2>01 Background</h2>
            <p>
                Bark+Play is an app that helps owners socialize their dogs by finding play dates for them. In the process
                of finding and interacting with others to set up play dates, the app encourages people to build stronger
                interpersonal relationships with others in their community. This personal project was inspired by my
                experiences.
            </p>

            <h3>How Does Bark+Play Work?</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>After account creation, a user can enable their GPS to locate nearby dogs on the map &mdash; they may also
                    just scroll through a list of dogs living in their city.</li>
                <li>Users request to meet up with other users to set up a play date.</li>
                <li>For successful play dates, owners can add other owners as friends and build a network.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Team & Roles</h3>
            <p>
                Because this was a personal project, I carried out all of the tasks. As a UX Designer,
                I investigated the problem, understood my users, did a competitive
                analysis, developed personas, brainstormed potential solutions, mapped the task flow, developed a brand,
                and created the mockups.

            <h2>02 Research</h2>
            <p>
                As a dog owner myself, I understand the challenge in being responsible for socializing a dog. A lack of
                socialization may lead them to behave aggressively at the sight of other dogs. Like us, dogs learn
                through experience and allowing them to experience the world is the best way to teach them how to behave
                properly. <b>So how can we help dogs who don't socialize often learn how to behave well with
                others?</b>
            </p>

            <h3>User Interviews</h3>
            <ul class="bullet">
                <li><b>Who?</b> I conducted qualitative interviews with five dog owners (ages 18-24). Three of them walked
                their dog frequently and two as often as they could.</li>
                <li><b>What?</b> In order to design a solution that facilitates dog socialization, I needed to understand
                <i>how</i> other owners socialize their dogs and <i>why.</i>
                    <ul class="bullet2">
                        <li>Where do you normally go to exercise your dog and why?</li>
                        <li>Tell me about a time when your dog, or someone else's dog, behaved aggressively &mdash;
                            what did you or the other person do to handle the situation?</li>
                        <li>Do other owners ever greet you as you walk your dog? Why do you think that is?</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>Where?</b> I interviewed everyone in-person.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="imagegallery">

            </div>

            <h4>Key Insights & Opportunities</h4>
            <p>Owners tend to tug on their dog's leash to keep them walking rather than stopping to socialize</p>
            <p>
                <b>How might we...</b> encourage owners to let their dogs interact with others?
            <ul class="bullet">
                <li>Dogs naturally want to interact with other dogs because they're curious, but we as owners
                    sometimes prevent them from doing so which may give our dogs a bad message</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>How might we...</b> create/facilitate time for owners to let their dogs interact with other dogs?
            <ul class="bullet">
                <li>Sometimes, dogs may not come across other dogs on their regular walks which is a lost
                    opportunity; other times owners just don't have the time to go for a walk</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>How might we...</b> assist owners to form connections with other owners within a neighborhood?
            <ul class="bullet">
                <li>It can feel odd sometimes to strike up conversations with others during a walk if there is no common
                    ground</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Brainstorm</h3>
            <p>
                I realized from my interviews that the socialization issue wasn’t just something
                that dogs had to improve on, but also us as members of a community. In relying on our phones to connect
                to our world &mdash; our banks, our coworkers, our loved ones &mdash; we become detached from the
                physical community in which we live. I understand why it’s hard for everyone to disconnect &mdash;
                I empathize because I also struggle &mdash; but our phone doesn’t have to be a problem. It can instead
                be the medium for solving the socialization issue present in our community and subsequently, our dogs.
            </p>

            <p>
                I brainstormed possible ways to help people form connections within their community with the goal of
                also helping dogs socialize. I didn't limit myself and wrote whatever came to mind.
            </p>

            <p>
                My ideas? A page on the city's website that lets owners post meet-ups, asking shelters to organize
                events for dog owners, building dog areas within city parks to encourage owners to frequent the city's
                parks... I wanted solutions that didn't impinge on owner's choice to participate.
            </p>

            <p>
                Then, I thought, why not just create an app? I did some research and found that there were two apps out
                there, but based on their reviews they weren't doing well. So, I thought, what are they doing wrong?
            </p>

            <h3>System Map</h3>
            <p>
                I designed a map of a system of actions for a task flow that encompasses the entire experience
                for a user.
            </p>

            <h3>Storyboard</h3>
            <p>
                Since I now had a better understanding of the experience and of my potential users, I proceeded to create
                a storyboard to help frame the context of when someone would use the app.
            </p>
            <div class="imagegallery">
                <img src="Images/BARK+PLAY/storyboard.png"/>
            </div>

            <h3>Creating a Brand</h3>
            <p>
                I created a style tile to develop the brand for my app. I chose colors that conveyed the feelings of
                fun, warmth, and joy which comes when meeting other people and their dogs.

            <h3>Screen Flows (Lo-Fi)</h3>
            <p>
                I sketched a series of screens that capture a user's experiences before, during, and after meeting up
                with another owner.
            </p>

            <h3>Hi-Fi Screens</h3>
            <p>
                I designed the final screens using the color palette and elements from my style tile. I tried to keep
                my designs as minimal and intuitive as possible in order to emphasize the experience that happens
                beyond the screen.

                <p>
                    The app uses the phone's GPS feature to determine where a user is and to share that with nearby
                    dog owners. Safety is a priority, so this feature is only in effect if a user gives permission
                    &mdash; it can be changed in the app's settings so that it doesn't use GPS at all or so that it
                    only uses it when the app has been opened. If GPS isn't used, then only the user's city is
                    displayed on the list of nearby dogs.

                    Sometimes a user may want to ask more questions about someone's dog before scheduling a play
                    date, or perhaps a user may want to suggest a meet up location. Maybe they just want to share
                    pictures from their last play date. For many reasons, a private messaging feature allows users
                    to get in touch and keep in touch.

                    basic information with friends/followers. Bark + Play's profiles help users learn about each
                    other and about their dogs. By giving users a profile, they will feel more comfortable with
                    requesting a play date because they will have learned a little bit more about the person/dog
                    they will be meeting with.

                    If the map view of nearby dogs isn't helpful &mdash; as in, perhaps no one in the area is using
                    GPS to show where they are &mdash; then users may look through a list of dogs living in the
                    city. If users have their GPS enabled within the app, then the list will display the distance
                    between them and another dog. Of course, the other user must also have their GPS enabled in
                    order for the distance to display. Aside from this list, users may also view their
                    friends list and request to meet up with one of them.

                    play dates are successful, then users are encouraged to add someone to their friends list. By
                    adding this feature, I hope to encourage users to form connections with people in their
                    neighborhood and push them to start conversations beyond the screen. Subsequently, through these
                    new formed friendships, the user's dogs will have regular play dates and new friends, which
                    translates to good social skills.

                Through this project, I learned how to understand users through empathy and through
                creating a product that facilitates behavioral change and delivers value to its users. I also practiced
                weaving digital and physical experiences into a product that emphasizes building interpersonal
                relationships in a real life setting. Bark + Play's purpose is to encourage users to meet members of their
                community and share their love for dogs while helping their dogs learn to socialize through play dates.
                I would hope that these interactions would generate awareness of diversity and connection within a
                neighborhood.

                I'm always looking to improve as a designer and a big part of this process is learning what my strengths
                and weaknesses are. I'm not a visual designer, but this project helped me pick up on some skills
                related to that by testing my interaction design abilities. My next steps would be to build a prototype
                out of my mockups and then test it with users. I would iterate on my designs for as much as I need to
                until I learn that my users are satisfied with what I've delivered.
