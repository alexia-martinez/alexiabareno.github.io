            <h2>01 Background</h2>
            <p>
                Canvas is a course management system that at the time was being considered for full integration at UCI.
                During the pilot period, we were tasked to evaluate the Canvas interface to determine two things:
                <b>Were there any issues present?</b> and <b>What do students think of the system?</b>
            </p>

            <h3>How Does Canvas Work?</h3>
            <p>
                The system allows instructors to manage their class by uploading readings, assigning tests, quizzes and
                homework, and updating/releasing grades. Students can access assignments, tests, quizzes, turn in
                completed assignments, engage in discussions with peers, and view their grades.
            </p>

            <h3>Team & Roles</h3>
            <p>
                I worked on this project with three peers from my Human-Computer Interaction and Evaluation class at
                UC Irvine. Together, we compiled our findings into a research document delivered to the UCI Office of
                Information Technology. A peer and I were responsible for conducting heuristic evaluations,
                cognitive walk-throughs, interviews, and usability tests.

<!--PREPARATION-->

            <h2>02 Preparation</h2>
            <p>
                I began by logging into Canvas and familiarizing myself with all sections of the site. I didn't have a
                hard time navigating it and there weren't any major issues that I had come across. After spending some
                time looking at Canvas alone, I regrouped with my team to discuss what we felt could be improved and
                tested.
            </p>

            <h3>Findings</h3>
            <ul class="bullet">
                <li><b>UI:</b> I thought that the font was too small in some areas and that text with links were barely
                    visible because of its font color. </li>
                <li><b>UX:</b> I thought that the class modules were cumbersome to navigate
                    because there was no way to filter by assignment type and the newest modules were
                    added to the very bottom of the page. A quarter at UCI is 10 weeks and I couldn't imaging the amount of
                    frustrated scrolling students would be doing to get to the latest module.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                To prepare for the think aloud sessions, I first sent out an email to confirm with the participants
                about
                our meeting time and to let them know what to expect so that they didn't feel uncomfortable during the
                session. Several days before the session, I created a set of
                <a class="link" target="_blank"
                   href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz1vVjCYZP7wMUNzaTZ6eHdUdGM/view">tasks</a>
                for the students to complete and ran them by my team to make sure that the potential issues they wanted
                to look into were included.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our tasks tested the usability of the Canvas system by focusing on the
                following functionalities: announcements, discussions, people, files, outcomes, modules, collaborations,
                and chat.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

<!--TESTING-->
<div id="testing">
    <div class="text2">
        <div class="wrapper">
            <h2>03 Testing</h2>
            <p>
                On the day of the session, one of my peers and I met with three students individually. I made sure to
                introduce myself so that I could break the ice and make the students feel comfortable about
                speaking to me during testing. I had read on UXPin that users feel more comfortable when they are
                reminded that they're testing the product and not their abilities. Letting them know that
                the product does not belong to our team makes them feel at ease and less likely to hold back on their
                thoughts, so I ended up following UXPin's advice and it helped a lot.
            </p>

            <p>
                Conducting usability tests wasn't as easy as I had imagined. The urge to help users while they were
                having a problem was very strong at some points, but I knew not to interfere because then I'd
                be introducing bias. I had learned in class that by letting users figure it out themselves, you can
                see unpredicted user behavior and workarounds that may inspire improvement.

<!--FINDINGS-->
<div id="findings">
    <div class="text">
        <div class="wrapper">
            <h2>04 Findings</h2>
            <p>
                After conducting my usability tests, our group came together to analyze our findings.
            </p>

            <p>
                About 80% of our users shared that Canvas had a user-friendly interface. Despite the overall positive
                reaction, the interviewees brought up the following issues:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>4 out of our 7 users had trouble finding the 'History' link that leads to an archive of chat
                    messages. It was colored a very light grey providing no contrast with the white background.
                </li>
                <li>The modules page proved inefficient to 2 users because it provided no way to filter by assignment
                    type. If a user is looking for the latest module, they must scroll to the bottom every time. Another
                    suggestion was to design the modules as tiles, providing a better overview of the course.
                </li>
                <li>Our participants experienced difficulty in finding the option that allowed them to add an image to
                    their discussion post. One user spoke for all of our participants when she suggested that the button
                    to embed an image should be larger, because the icon was too small to discern what it's for.
                </li>
                <li>All of our non-Canvas users struggled to find the zip icon at the top right corner of the page
                    because it was too small and the icon was unfamiliar.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                To correct these issues, we made some changes to Canvas as shown below. The goal was to make these
                available actions obvious to the user.
            </p>

            <div class="imagegallery">
                <p>The font color for links was made darker.</p>
                <img src="Images/CANVAS/canvashistory.png"/>
                <br><br>
                <p>Modules could be filtered by assignment type and sorted by due date and date
                    posted.</p>
                <img src="Images/CANVAS/canvasmodule.png"/>
                <br><br>
                <p>A panel to add images to a post was introduced on the right. Users can see uploaded images.</p>
                <img src="Images/CANVAS/canvaspanel.png"/>
                <br><br>
                <p>A recognizable zip file icon was added.</p>
                <img src="Images/CANVAS/canvaszip.png"/>
            </div>

            <p>
                The biggest issue we encountered while looking into the Outcomes feature was an error handling issue.
                This section details the instructorâ€™s expectations for each assignment. The user may click and drag
                files but once they release the mouse button to where they would like to move it, nothing shifts.
            </p>

            <p>
                If a user attempts to drag one of these files to the overarching folder at the top of the list, Canvas
                yields two error messages at the top of the screen and the system temporarily becomes unresponsive.
                Users, however, may still continue to click and drag the files which yields many error messages at the
                top of the page.
            </p>

            <div class="imagegallery">
                <img src="Images/CANVAS/canvaserror.png"/>
            </div>

            <p>
                We flagged this as a major issue that required the developer's attention since it wasn't an interface
                problem.

            <p>
                I was continually finding myself out of my comfort zone during this project.
                I was challenged to clearly express my thoughts among my group and with users. I overcame my fear of
                interviewing strangers by recognizing that I was there to help them.
                I learned that part of being a successful designer is knowing how to build rapport with users in
                order to have a testing session that yields valuable insight.
            </p>

            <p>
                My takeaway from this class is that there's always room for improvement and usability tests are
                invaluable when trying to identify what needs to be fixed.
